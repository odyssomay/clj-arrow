** Usage and installation

First add [clj-arrow "1.0.2-SNAPSHOT"] as a dependency in leiningen, or put the jar on the classpath (requires only clojure).
Then =use=, or =require= clj-arrow.arrow. In this namespace these functions exist (see docstrings for usage):

- =>>>= - create a flow of functions to the right.
- =<<<= - create a flow of functions to the left.
- =fst= - apply a function to the first value of a pair.
- =snd= - apply a function to the second value of a pair.
- =***= - apply two functions to respective values of a pair.
- =&&&= - same as =***=, but takes a single value which is cloned to a pair.
- =|||= - an =if= conditional statement for functions.

** Multithreading

If the function =set-multithreading-on= is called, multithreading is turned on for the =***= and =&&&= functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(time ((&&& #(Thread/sleep %) #(Thread/sleep %)) 1000))
;   "Elapsed time: 2006.765373 msecs"
;=> [nil nil]

(set-multithreading-on)
;=> true

(time ((&&& #(Thread/sleep %) #(Thread/sleep %)) 1000))
;   "Elapsed time: 1004.629826 msecs"
;=> [nil nil]
#+END_SRC
